### Kilo
A very basic text editor in C following [this](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) tutorial based on [antirez's kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo).
Commits of each stage hopefully.

#### Todo
 - [x] Basic functionality
 - [ ] Add languages for syntax highlighting
 - [ ] Implement config file with syntax options, tab/space options etc.
 - [x] Automatic brace/bracket completion
 - [ ] Auto-indent for different languages
 - [ ] make alt key functional, eg. alt+up/down swaps lines
 - [ ] alt-shift to copy lines
 - [ ] Rewrite in C++?
